package stablecoin

// the idea of this stablecoin package is to issue a stablecoin on stellar testnet
// so that we can test the function of something similar on mainnet. The stablecoin
// provider should be stored in a different database because we will not be migrating
// this.

// The idea is to issue a single USD token for every USD t hat we receive on our
// account, this should be automated and we must not have any kind of user interaction that is in
// place here. We also need a stablecoin Code, which we shall call as "STABLEUSD"
// for easy reference. Most functions would be similar to the one in assets.go,
// but need to be tailored to suit our requirements

// the USD token defined here is what is issued by the speciifc bank. Ideally, we
// could accept a tx hash and check it as well, but since we can query balances,
// much easier to do it this way.
// or can be something like a stablecoin or token
