// Contract auctions are specific for public infrastructure and for projects with multiple stakeholders
// where transparency is important. The main point is to avoid corruption and produce positive competition 
// among providers. When funding solar project using international investor money, transparency and auditability 
// to them is  also a crucial aspect since they are often not close to the project, and want to make sure there
// is a tobust due diligence prior to unlocking the funds. 

// Different Auctions or Tenders are designed based on the nature of the project. 
// In general, the criteria for selection is price, technical quality (eg. hardware), engineering model, development time
// and other perks offered by developers (eg. extra guarantees).

// you need to have a lock in period beyond which contractors can not post what
// stuff they want. now, how do you choose which contractor wins? Ideally,
// the school would want the most stuff but you need to vet which contracts are good
// and not.
