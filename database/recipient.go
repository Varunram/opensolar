// Payback is called when the receiver of the DEBToken wants to pay a fixed amount
// of money back to the issuer of the DEBTokens. One way to imagine this would be
// like an electricity bill, something that people pay monthly but only that in this
// case, the electricity is free, so they pay directly towards the solar panels.

// The process of Payback roughly involves the following steps:
// 1. Pay the issuer in DEBTokens with whatever amount desired.
// (MW: This amount to pay should be related to the energy generated and consumed, based on the teller. isnt it so?)
// The oracle price of
// electricity cost is a lower bound (since the government would not like it if people
// default on their payments) (MW: Explain this lower bound and default issue more). Anything below the lower bound gets a warning in
// project for people to pay more, we could also have a threshold mechanism that says
// if a person constantly defaults for more than half the owed amount for three
// consecutive months, we sell power directly to the grid. THis could also be used
// for a rating system, where the frontend UI can have a rating based on whether
// the recipient has defaulted or not in the past.
// 2. The receiver checks whether the amount is greater than Oracle Threshold and
// if so, sends back PBTokens, which stand for the month equivalent of payments.
// eg. the school has opted for a 5 year payback period, the school owes the issuer
// 60 PBTokens and the issuer sends back 1PBToken every month if the school pays
// invested_amount/60 DEBTokens back to the issuer
// 3. The recipient checks whether the PBTokens received correlate to the amount
// that it sent and if not, raises the dispute since the forward DEBToken payment
// is on chain and resolves the dispute itself using existing off chain legal frameworks
// (issued bonds, agreements, etc)
