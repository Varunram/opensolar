// package assets contains asset related functions like calculating AssetID and
// sets up DEBTokens, PBTokens and INVTokens for a specific project that it has been
// passed
// the entities in the system are described in the README file and this part
// will explain how the PBTokens, INVTokens and DEBTokens work.

// TODO: Consider removing the name token here, since all it does is issuing receipts and proofs of transactions, to keep track of balances
// Token is a word that has been eroded in the blockchain space

// 1. INVToken - An INVToken is issued by the issuer for every USD that the investor
// has invested in the contract. This peg needs to be ensured maybe in protocol
// with stablecoins on Stellar or we need to provide an easy onboarding scheme
// for users into the crypto world using other means. The investor receives
// INVTokens as proof of investment but profit return mechanism is not taken into
// account here, since htat needs clear definition on how much investors get each
// period for investing in the project.

// TODO: INVTokens should be set with an
// immutable flag so that the isuser can't renege on issuing this assets at any
// future time.

// 2. DEBToken - for each INVToken (and indirectly, USD invested in the project),
// we issue a DEBToken to the recipient of the assets so that they can pay us back.
// DEBTokens are also lunked with PBTokens and they should be immutable as well,
// so that the issuer can not change the amount of debt at any point in the future.
// MW: Mention that DEBTokens are not equal to INVTokens since there must be an interest %
// that needs to be paid to investors, which is also part of the DEBToken

// 3. PBToken - each PBToken denoted a month of appropriate payback. A month's worth
// of payback is decided by the recipient, who decides the payback period of the
// given assets at the time of creation. PBTokens are non-fungible, it means
// that one project's payback token is not worth the same as the other project's PBToken.
// the other two tokens are fungible - each INVToken is worth +1USD and each DEBToken
// is worth -1 USD and can be transferred to other peers willing to take profit / debt
// on behalf of the above entities. SInce PBToken is not fungible, the flag
// authorization_required needs to be set and a party without a trustline with
// the issuer can not trade in this asset (and ideally, the issuer will not accept
// trustlines in this new asset)
// MW: Consider that the PBTokens in general are not an arbitrary decision of the recipient
// rather its set by an agreement of utility or rent payment, tied to the information from
// from an IoT device (i.e a powermeter in the case of solar).

// The hard part is ensuring that the assets are pegged to the USD in a stable way.
// we could ensure the peg ourselves by accepting USD off chain, but that's not provable
// on chain and the investor has to trust the issuer with that. Also, in this case,
// anonymous investors wouldn't be able to invest, which is something that would be
// nice to have
// TODO: Add flags to assets, onboarding

// INVAsset and PBAssets are names used because Stellar calls these receipts and proofs 'Assets,' and we are calling them tokens (for now).
